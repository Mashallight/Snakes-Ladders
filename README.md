# Snakes-Ladders 
For this assignment 2, I made a Snakes and ladders game that is text base just using HTML and JavaScript.
<br></br>
a) I used arrays to keep the current position of 2 players.
<br></br>
b) The players take turns to roll a normal 6-sided die. I Used Math.random() to simulate the roll of a die.
<br></br>
c) I created the board game that has a maximum of 25 cells.
<br></br>
<br></br>
The rules of the game:
<br></br>
1. There are 2 snakes:
<br></br>
 • At position 15, they will fall to position 5.
 <br></br>
 • At position 23, they will fall to position 16.
 <br></br>
 <br></br>
2. There are 2 ladders:
<br></br>
• If players land at position 8, they will advance to position 15.
<br></br>
• If players land at position 19, they will advance to position 24. 
<br></br>
3. The first player that passes square 25 wins the game.
