# Snakes-Ladders
Snakes &amp; Ladders game 
For this assignment 2, I made a Snakes and ladders game that is text base just using HTML and JavaScript.
<br></br>
a) Use arrays to keep the current position of 2 players.
b) The players take turns to roll a normal 6-sided die.
Use Math.random() to simulate the roll of a die.
c) The board game has a maximum of 25 cells.
The first player that passes square 25 wins the game.
 d) Position of the snakes:
 • If players land at position 15, they will fall to position 5.
• If players land at position 23, they will fall to position 16.
e) Position of the ladders:
• If players land at position 8, they will advance to position 15.
• If players land at position 19, they will advance to position 24.
